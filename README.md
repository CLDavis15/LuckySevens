# LuckySevens

A betting dice roll game that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

You start at $0.00 bet and have to add money to start playing. If not you will receive an error prompting you to add money.

The game uses two 6 sided dice to roll. If they equal 7 then you win $4 if not you lose $1. The program runs until you run out of money. 

It tracks how many rolls until you go broke, highest amount of money that you won, and the roll count at which you one the most money.
